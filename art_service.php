	         <p>Art is not, as the metaphysicians say, the manifestation of some mysterious idea of beauty or God; it is not, as the aesthetical physiologists say, a game in which man lets off his excess of stored-up energy; it is not the expression of man’s emotions by external signs; it is not the production of pleasing objects; and, above all, it is not inly pleasure; but it is a means of union among men, joining them together in the same feelings, and indispensable for the life and progress toward well-being of individuals and of humanity. – Leo Tolstoy

		               <p>Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions. Sculpture has been central in relegious devotion in many cultures, and until recent centuries large sculptures, too expensive for private individuals to create, were usually an expression of relegious and politics.
